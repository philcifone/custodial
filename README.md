### currently have graphs for:
- daily glove count (generalAnalysis.py)
- average duration of task per section (generalAnalysis.py, durationPerSection.py)
- dirt level per section (generalAnalysis.py)
- duration per square foot per section (generalAnalysis.py, squareFootDuration.py)
- average dirt levels by weekday (dirtLevelsWeekdays.py)
- daily average task duration (dailyAverageTaskDuration.py)
- dirt level distribution (dirtLevelDist.py)
- daily average dirt level (dailyAverageDirtLevel.py)

### to do:

#### graphs to make:

- dual graphs:
    - gloves vs dirt level
    - weather conditions vs task count
    - moon phase vs dirt level
    - task count vs section
    - task count vs day of week
