# custodial

## data analysis of nighttime custodial duties at an average sized middle school

### capturing data points:
- outside weather
- personal step count
- moon illumination percentage
- section/task
- duration
- dirt level (personal judgement)
- glove usage (count once thrown away)
- supplies

### currently have graphs for:
- daily glove count (generalAnalysis.py)
- average duration of task per section (generalAnalysis.py, durationPerSection.py)
- dirt level per section (generalAnalysis.py)
- duration per square foot per section (generalAnalysis.py, squareFootDuration.py)
- average dirt levels by weekday (dirtLevelsWeekdays.py)
- daily average task duration (dailyAverageTaskDuration.py)
- dirt level distribution (dirtLevelDist.py)
- daily average dirt level (dailyAverageDirtLevel.py)

### to do:

- better padding/formatting for stand alone graphs

#### graphs to make:

- dual graphs? temp vs dirt levels?
